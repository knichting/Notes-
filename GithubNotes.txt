Pull request - working on someone else's project
	- See error in their document
	- You don't have the rights to make changes to their master
	- Create own fork in their project, create own edited version
	- Create pull request telling owner of changes made and they can either accept or ignore it 
	- Essentially a request for the owner to pull your code 


Cloning - copy others code to your desktop 
	- May or may not make changes to it

Forking - something you may have cloned 
	- You make changes 
	- Fork their project 
	- It will show up almost as if it is your own project 
	- Will say "Forked from XYZ"
	- Then you can make the changes you want to their project
